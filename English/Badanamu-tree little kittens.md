Three little kittens,  
they lose their mittens,  
and they began to cry.  
Oh,Mother Dear,  
we sadly fear,   
our mittens we have lost.   
Lost your mittens,  
you naughty kittens!  
Then you shall have no pie.  
Meow!  Meow!  
No, you shall have no pie.  

The three little kittens found their mittens,  
and they began to cry.  
Oh,Mother Dear,  
see here, see here!  
Our mittens we have found.  
Put on your mittens,  
you silly kittens,  
and you shall have some pie.  
Meow! Mwow!  
Oh,let us have some pie.   

The three kittens  put on their mittens,  
and soon ate up the pie.  
Oh,Mother Dear,  
we greatly fear our mittens we have soiled.   
Soiled your mittens,  
you naughtly kittens!   
Then they began to sigh.  
Meow! Meow!
Then they began to sign.  

Three little kittens,  
they washed thier mittens,  
and hung them out to dry.  
Oh,Mother Dear,  
do you not hear?  
our mittens we have washed.  
Washed your mittens ?  
Then you're good kittens.  
Let's all have some pie.
Meow! Meow!
Let's all have some pie!
